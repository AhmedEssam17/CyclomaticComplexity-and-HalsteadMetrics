# CyclomaticComplexity-and-HalsteadMetrics
Calculates Halstead Metric and Cyclomatic Complexity for a given C file.

A code parsing algorithm is implemented from A to Z without using pycparser library.

Project is supported by a simple GUI (tkinter) to display the code existing in the input file with the calculated metrics.
